### **Checkpoint: Base Score Calculation**
* **Action:** Stop and calculate the sum of Q1–Q24.
* **Output:** "Base Score Subtotal: [X]/[Max]"

---

### AI Assessment Questions (Qualitative)
**Required Action:**
* **Research First:** Use web search to find analyst consensus, recent headlines, insider transactions, SEC filings, and peer comparisons before scoring.
* **Zero Policy:** Do not default to 0 without attempting research. State the specific search query used if data is missing.
* **Default:** Default to 0 *only* if search returns no relevant data after 3 attempts.

**Q25. Competitive Moat**
* Dominant market position, pricing power, high switching costs → +1 point
* No moat, commoditized, or facing disruption → -1 point
* Neutral → 0 points

**Q26. Growth Sustainability** 
* Durable drivers (recurring revenue, secular trend, expanding TAM) → +1 point
* One-time boost, hype-driven, or decelerating without catalyst → -1 point
* Neutral → 0 points

**Q27. Balance Sheet Quality** 
* Fortress (net cash, no debt concerns beyond Q12) → +1 point
* Hidden leverage, off-balance-sheet risk, or covenant concerns → -1 point
* Neutral → 0 points

**Q28. Valuation vs Peers** 
* Trading at discount to comparable peers → +1 point
* Extreme premium without justification → -1 point
* Neutral → 0 points

**Q29. Execution & Management** 
* Proven track record, aligned incentives, strong insider buying → +1 point
* Red flags (SEC issues, turnover, meme/squeeze target, controversy) → -1 point
* Neutral → 0 points

## Event-Driven Adjustment (±2 points)
**Required Action:** Search for recent news (earnings, FDA decisions, product launches, executive changes, guidance updates) before assigning 0.
- For time-sensitive factors not captured in Base Points Questions:
- Catalyst (earnings, FDA, product launch, acquisition) → ±1 to ±2 points
- Restructuring/layoffs (efficiency vs. distress) → ±1 point
- Turnaround inflection point → +1 point
- Imminent negative event (lockup expiry, debt maturity) → -1 to -2 points

State reason and direction. Use 0 points if nothing applies.

## Score Calculation 
**Formula:** `TOTAL = Base Points + AI Assessment + Event-Driven`

## Tier and category Assignment
**Tier 1:** ALL of:
- Profitable (Net Profit Margin > 0)
- Market Cap > $50B
- Debt/Equity Ratio < 1.5
- Weighted Alpha ≥ 0 (not in decline)

**Tier 2:** Profitable AND meets 2 of 3:
- Market Cap > $5B
- Debt/Equity Ratio < 2.0
- Weighted Alpha ≥ 0

**Tier 3:** Profitable but fails T1/T2 criteria, OR unprofitable with Quarterly Sales Growth > 0

**Short Candidate:** Score <35 AND 1-Month Put Open Interest >1,000 AND Short Interest as % of Float <15%
**Avoid:** Score <35 (and not Short Candidate)

**Tags (apply to any tier):**
- **Turtle:** 52-Week Price Change between -10% and +10% AND 1-Month Price Change between -10% and +10%

### Tier Notes
- **Distinction:** Tiers are risk caps, not quality rankings.
    - **Score** determines the rank (How good is the stock?).
    - **Tier** determines the position size (How much should I buy?).
- **Display:** Report the Tier and any Tags clearly next to the final score.
