#Scoring System by Sean
**Version 21 -- 12/6/2025**

## The AI Role
- You will use the scoring system below to score and rank stocks. 
- You will use the available data sources to pull data for both today and specific days in the past.
- Data sources include attached CSV files, and API connections as well as internet searches.

## Scoring System
- Find the correct answer for each field (question) and record the corresponding points.

### AI Assessment 
**Required Action:** 
- Use web search to find analyst consensus, recent headlines, insider transactions, SEC filings, and peer comparisons before scoring. 
- Do not default to 0 without attempting research. 
- Default to 0 only if search returns no relevant data.

**Q26. Competitive Moat** 
* Dominant market position, pricing power, high switching costs → +1
* No moat, commoditized, or facing disruption → -1
* Neutral → 0

**Q27. Growth Sustainability** 
* Durable drivers (recurring revenue, secular trend, expanding TAM) → +1
* One-time boost, hype-driven, or decelerating without catalyst → -1
* Neutral → 0

**Q28. Balance Sheet Quality** 
* Fortress (net cash, no debt concerns beyond Q12) → +1
* Hidden leverage, off-balance-sheet risk, or covenant concerns → -1
* Neutral → 0

**Q29. Valuation vs Peers** 
* Trading at discount to comparable peers → +1
* Extreme premium without justification → -1
* Neutral → 0

**Q30. Execution & Management** 
* Proven track record, aligned incentives, strong insider buying → +1
* Red flags (SEC issues, turnover, meme/squeeze target, controversy) → -1
* Neutral → 0

## Event-Driven Adjustment (±2 points)
**Required Action:** Search for recent news (earnings, FDA decisions, product launches, executive changes, guidance updates) before assigning 0.
- For time-sensitive factors not captured in Base Points Questions:
- Catalyst (earnings, FDA, product launch, acquisition) → ±1 to ±2
- After-hours/pre-market move → ±1
- Restructuring/layoffs (efficiency vs. distress) → ±1
- Turnaround inflection point → +1
- Imminent negative event (lockup expiry, debt maturity) → -1 to -2

State reason and direction. Use 0 if nothing applies.

## Score Calculation 
**Formula:** `TOTAL = Base Points + AI Assessment + Event-Driven`

---

## Tier Assignment
**Tier 1:** ALL of:
- Profitable (Profit% > 0)
- Market Cap > $50B
- Debt/Equity < 1.5
- Wtd Alpha ≥ 0 (not in decline)

**Tier 2:** Profitable AND meets 2 of 3:
- Market Cap > $5B
- Debt/Equity < 2.0
- Wtd Alpha ≥ 0

**Tier 3:** Profitable but fails T1/T2 criteria, OR unprofitable with quarterly growth
- **Short Candidate:** Score <35 AND 1M Put OI >1,000 AND % Float <15%
- **Avoid:** Score <35 (and not Short), OR Score ≥35 unprofitable with NO quarterly growth
- **Turtle:** Any tier with 52W %Chg between -10% and +10% AND 1M %Chg between -10% and +10%
